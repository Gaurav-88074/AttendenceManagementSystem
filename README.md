# AttendenceManagementSystem
The purpose of this project is to create a solution for attendance management for teachers and facilitators.
We have created a web application that provides an intuiative interface to interact with, this web application will
solely organize students belonging to each subject that a teacher teaches. This will ensure a seamless solution for
taking attendance for individual subjects.
